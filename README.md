# Customer-Shopping-Behavior-Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes **customer shopping behavior** using an e-commerce retail dataset.
The goal is to understand how **discounts, purchase frequency, product categories, and seasonality** influence customer purchasing decisions and sales stability.

The analysis focuses on **business-driven insights**, not modeling, making it suitable for stakeholder decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Business Problems

1. **Do discounts actually increase customer spending?**
2. **Which product categories perform consistently across seasons and should always be in stock?**

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains customer demographics, transaction details, and behavioral attributes, including:

* Customer profile (Age, Gender, Location)
* Purchase details (Category, Item, Purchase Amount)
* Behavioral signals (Discount Applied, Frequency of Purchases, Subscription Status)
* Seasonal information (Season, Shipping Type, Promo Code Usage)

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

* Descriptive statistics (mean, median, distribution)
* Discount vs non-discount purchase comparison
* Purchase frequency behavior analysis
* Seasonal sales analysis by product category
* Sales stability analysis using standard deviation

---

## 💡 Key Insights

* **Discounts do not significantly increase average purchase value.**
  Customers without discounts tend to spend slightly more per transaction.

* **Customer purchasing behavior is stable across all frequencies.**
  In every purchase frequency group, non-discount purchases dominate.

* **Clothing is the top-selling but most volatile category.**
  Strongly affected by seasonality and trends.

* **Footwear and Outerwear are the most stable categories.**
  Sales are consistent across seasons, making them low-risk inventory items.

* **Seasonality affects specific categories, not all products.**

---

## 🧠 Business Recommendations

* Use **discounts selectively** (customer acquisition or seasonal campaigns), not as a core revenue strategy.
* Focus **seasonal promotions on Clothing**, where impact is highest.
* Maintain **consistent stock levels for Footwear and Outerwear**.
* Shift strategy toward **customer experience and product value**, not price competition.
